                            Migration of sitecore sites from various version from 6.5-8 to a consolidated Sitecore 9.2 instance.

                        </p>
                            A number of legacy sites are fronted by an F5 IRules instance.  This routes requests to disparate 
                            sites while presenting a consistent URL/IAL structure to the user.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As part of the migration I spent some time in refactoring and remediating these rules, to allow easier 
                            development, automated testing of the rules, and providing patterns to help organise and identify related
                            groups of rules making decommissioning easier once migration was completed.

                            Utilised automating spidering and scanning tools to identify performance problems.  Demonstrated basic 
                            statistical methods to identify performance problems from the raw scanning data, reducing page load 
                            times from around 15 seconds to ~400ms.

                            A Sitecore 8 intranet site to provide information to call center operators. In this project
                            we aimed for zero outage deployments, and implemented a blue/green deployment strategy with
                            Visual Studio Team Services and Azure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Deployments had controlled quality gateways, where a delegated person could approve or
                            disapprove the release at several checkpoints, and a set of automated Selenium smoke tests
                            to
                            provide production verification.
                        </p>
                        <p>The solution had several other interesting aspects such as:</p>

                            <li>Extensive use and customization of the SOLR search engine in Sitecore, to allow
                                spellchecking, highlighting and faceting of search results</li>
                            <li>Deep integration of Sitecore analytics back into the Sitecore Experience Editor. This
                                allowed authors to see basic sentiment analysis for their content</li>

                            Building an Umbraco v6 site with deep integration into an ASP.NET MVC4 web application.
                            A solution was designed to use Umbraco as a resource database, managing all content
                            resources for the MVC application,
                            such as labels, content and validation error messages. Additionally I built out most of the

                            integration for the MVC application. The solution was supported by unit tests leveraging
                            mstest and moq.

                            As senior developer within the team I successfully delivered a new bespoke security
                            component using Active Directory, NT and anonymous access to allow integrated application
                            security from the legacy NT and new AD domains, as well as external access to the
                            network via an anonymous web server. The component was written in C# .NET 1.1 and
                            exposed a COM compliant interface to allow for backwards compatibility to VB6 and
                            classic ASP.
