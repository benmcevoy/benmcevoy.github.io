                            Building an Umbraco v6 site with deep integration into an ASP.NET MVC4 web application.
                            A solution was designed to use Umbraco as a resource database, managing all content resources for the MVC application,
                            such as labels, content and validation error messages. Additionally I built out most of the service and security
                            integration for the MVC application.  The solution was supported by unit tests leveraging mstest and moq.

                        <h4>ESTA - Victorian Department of Justice</h4>
                        <p>
                            ESTA required a reporting solution over a large dataset (many millions of rows). The data was
                            imported and mapped to a SQL database schema of our design, and optimised stored procedures
                            created to extract the report data for presentation in a SQL Server Reporting Services portal.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Victorian Department of Health</h4>
                        <p>
                            The DoH had a new data reporting requirement for hospitals.  Working with a business analysts
                            I produced a technical specification and XML schema for the new data feed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The specification included the data specification, as well as documenting data flow through
                            to the DOH's new data warehousing solution and out to datamarts for final consumption by interested parties.
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, I also worked on the DOH datawarehousing system, creating and deploying several SSIS ETL packages.</p>

                            network via an anonymous web server. The component was written in C# .NET 1.1 and
                            exposed a COM compliant interface to allow for backwards compatibility to VB6 and
                            classic ASP.
