		<h3>BUPA | Melbourne, AU | Aug 2023 - Mar 2024
		</h3>
		<h4>Senior Engineer</h4>
		<p>Senior engineer on a SaaS style Sitecore platform, utilising SiteCore 10 Headless for multiple tenants and
			sites.

		<p>The platform is hosted on Azure Kubernetes, with NextJS+React rendering hosts. I worked across the team
			helping with the frontend and devops, particularly in triaging NextJS and Sitecore integration issues.</p>
		<p>I also produced several research documents to help the product owner and business analysts plan out new
			features.</p>

		<h3>Holding Redlich | Melbourne, AU | April 2022 - June 2023</h3>

		<h4>Senior Developer</h4>
		<p>Migration of sitecore sites from various versions of Sitecore

		</p>
		<p>A number of legacy sites are fronted by an F5 IRules instance.
			This routes requests to disparate sites while presenting a
			consistent URL/IAL structure to the user.
		</p>
		<p>As part of the migration I spent some time in refactoring and
			remediating the F5 TCL IRules, to allow easier development,
			automated testing of the rules, and providing patterns to help
			organise and identify related groups of rules making decommissioning
			easier once migration was completed.
		</p>
		<p>Utilised automating spidering and scanning tools to identify
			performance problems. Demonstrated basic statistical methods to
			identify performance problems from the raw scanning data, reducing
			page load times from around 15 seconds to ~300ms.

			For sitecore this involved creating custom OWIN middleware to
			support OAUTH PKCE flow, and auth code flows.
